In some systems and processes, a list of invited bidders will be published at the start of tendering, and full details and documents on the bids received may be disclosed when evaluation is complete. In other systems, only summary statistics on the number of bids received may be made public.\n\nThe OCDS bid extension introduces a new, flexible, top-level section to each contracting process to capture bidding information. Implementers will need to assess which fields are applicable to their local regulatory regime, and to local use-cases.\n\n## Bid Statistics\n\nThe `bids/bidStatistics` array can be used to represent key statistical information about the number of bids and bidders. Each entry in the array is a `BidsStatistic` object containing at least:\n\n* An identifier;\n* A measure, from the bidStatistics codelist;\n* A value for that measure;\n\n```eval_rst\n.. extensiontable::\n   :extension: bids\n   :definitions: BidsStatistic\n```\n\n### Bid Statistics Codelist\n\nThis is an **open** codelist. Publishers can add their own codes to this list. When doing so, publishers are encouraged to engage with the open contracting community to agree upon definitions of each code.\n\nFor example, publishers may wish to add statistics on minority or women owned businesses, or bids that meet certain environmental standards and targets.\n\nThe codelist's Category column indicates whether the statistic applies to bids or bidders or whether it is specified or required by a particular regulatory context (e.g. EU).\n\n```eval_rst\n.. csv-table-no-translate::\n   :header-rows: 1\n   :file: ../../../../build/codelists/current_lang/bidStatistics.csv\n```\n\n## Bid Details\n\nThe `bids/details` array is used to provide one or more `Bid` objects, each representing a unique bid received.\n\n```eval_rst\n.. extensiontable::\n   :extension: bids\n   :definitions: Bid\n```\n\n### Bid Status Codelist\n\n```eval_rst\n.. csv-table-no-translate::\n   :header-rows: 1\n   :file: ../../../../build/codelists/current_lang/bidStatus.csv\n```\n\n## Example\n\nBelow is an example of a bids extension:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"bids\": {\n    \"statistics\": [{\n      \"id\": \"1.0\",\n      \"measure\": \"validBids\",\n      \"value\": 1,\n      \"date\": \"2016-12-09T01:00:00+01:00\",\n      \"notes\": \"This statistic covers the total number of unique bids received that were considered valid against relevant criteria.\"\n    }, {\n      \"id\": \"2.0\",\n      \"measure\": \"disqualifiedBids\",\n      \"value\": 1,\n      \"date\": \"2016-12-10T01:00:00+01:00\",\n      \"notes\": \"This statistic covers the total number of unique bids received that were disqualified.\"\n    }],\n    \"details\": [{\n      \"id\": \"1.0\",\n      \"date\": \"2016-12-09T01:00:00+01:00\",\n      \"status\": \"valid\",\n      \"value\": {\n        \"amount\": 1000,\n        \"currency\": \"USD\"\n      },\n      \"documents\": [{\n        \"id\": \"1.0\",\n        \"documentType\": \"evaluationReports\",\n        \"title\": \"Mega Consortium Bid Evaluation Report\",\n        \"description\": \"This document provides details of the evaluation of the bid submitted by Mega Consortium\",\n        \"url\": \"http://communications.gov.example/example_ppp/evaluationReport_megaConsortium.pdf\",\n        \"datePublished\": \"2016-11-17T10:00:00-06:00\",\n        \"format\": \"application/pdf\",\n        \"language\": \"en\",\n        \"author\": \"Ministry of Communications\"\n      }],\n      \"tenderers\": [{\n        \"id\": \"MEGA\",\n        \"name\": \"Mega Consortium\"\n      }]\n    }, {\n      \"id\": \"2.0\",\n      \"date\": \"2016-12-10T01:00:00+01:00\",\n      \"status\": \"disqualified\",\n      \"value\": {\n        \"amount\": 1500,\n        \"currency\": \"USD\"\n      },\n      \"documents\": [{\n        \"id\": \"1.0\",\n        \"documentType\": \"evaluationReports\",\n        \"title\": \"Beta Consortium Bid Evaluation Report\",\n        \"description\": \"This document provides details of the evaluation of the bid submitted by Beta Consortium\",\n        \"url\": \"http://communications.gov.example/example_ppp/evaluationReport_betaConsortium.pdf\",\n        \"datePublished\": \"2016-11-18T10:00:00-06:00\",\n        \"format\": \"application/pdf\",\n        \"language\": \"en\",\n        \"author\": \"Ministry of Communications\"\n      }],\n      \"tenderers\": [{\n        \"id\": \"BETA\",\n        \"name\": \"Beta Consortium\"\n      }]\n    }]\n\n  },\n  \"awards\": [{\n    \"id\": \"111\",\n    \"title\": \"Example PPP contract award\",\n    \"description\": \"Award of Example PPP contract to Mega Consortium\",\n    \"status\": \"active\",\n    \"date\": \"2016-12-17T10:00:00-06:00\",\n    \"relatedBid\": \"1.0\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n## Issues\n\nReport issues for this extension in the [ocds-extensions repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-extensions/issues), putting the extension's name in the issue's title.\n\n## Changelog\n\n### v1.1.3\n\n* Disallow required fields `BidsStatistic.id`, `BidsStatistic.measure`, `BidsStatistic.value` from being null\n* Disallow `Bids.statistics` from having null in its array of objects\n* Allow `Bids.statistics` to be null\n* Add enum to `BidsStatistic.status`\n* Move `BidsStatistic.requirementResponses` to requirements extension\n* Add descriptions to bidStatus.csv\n* List codelists in extension.json\n* Add example to documentation\n* Add tests and tidy code\n",

In some systems and processes, a list of invited bidders will be published at the start of tendering, and full details and documents on the bids recieved may be disclosed when evaluation is complete. In other systems, only summary statistics on the number of bids received may be made public.\n\nThe OCDS bid extension introduces a new, flexible, top-level section to each contracting process to capture bidding information. Implementers will need to assess which fields are applicable to their local regulatory regime, and to local use-cases.\n\n### Bid Statistics\n\nThe ```bids/bidStatistics``` array can be used to represent key statistical information about the number of bids and bidders. Each entry in the array is a ```BidStatistic``` object containing at least:\n\n* An identifier;\n* A measure, from the bidStatistics codelist;\n* A value for that measure;\n\n#### Bid Statistics Schema \n\n```eval_rst\n.. extensiontable::\n   :extension: bids\n   :exclude_definitions: Bids Bid\n```\n\n#### Bid Statistics Codelists\n\nThis is an **open** codelist. Publishers can add their own codes to this list. When doing so, publishers are encouraged to engage with the open contracting community to agree upon definitions of each code. \n\nFor example, publishers may wish to add statistics on minority or women owned businesses, or bids that meet certain environmental standards and targets. \n\n```eval_rst\n.. csv-table::\n   :header-rows: 1\n   :file: standard/docs/en/extensions/codelists/bidStatistics.csv\n```\n\n### Bid details\n\nThe ```bids/details``` array is used to provide one or more ```Bid``` objects, each representing a unique bid received. \n\n```eval_rst\n.. extensiontable::\n   :extension: bids\n   :exclude_definitions: BidStatistics\n```\n\n### Example\n\nToDo",

In some systems and processes, a list of invited bidders will be published at the start of tendering, and full details and documents on the bids received may be disclosed when evaluation is complete. In other systems, only summary statistics on the number of bids received may be made public.\n\nThe OCDS bid extension introduces a new, flexible, top-level section to each contracting process to capture bidding information. Implementers will need to assess which fields are applicable to their local regulatory regime, and to local use-cases.\n\n### Bid Statistics\n\nThe ```bids/bidStatistics``` array can be used to represent key statistical information about the number of bids and bidders. Each entry in the array is a ```BidsStatistic``` object containing at least:\n\n* An identifier;\n* A measure, from the bidStatistics codelist;\n* A value for that measure;\n\n#### Bid Statistics Schema \n\n```eval_rst\n.. extensiontable::\n   :extension: bids\n   :exclude_definitions: Bids Bid\n```\n\n#### Bid Statistics Codelist\n\nThis is an **open** codelist. Publishers can add their own codes to this list. When doing so, publishers are encouraged to engage with the open contracting community to agree upon definitions of each code. \n\nFor example, publishers may wish to add statistics on minority or women owned businesses, or bids that meet certain environmental standards and targets. \n\n```eval_rst\n.. csv-table-no-translate::\n   :header-rows: 1\n   :file: codelists_translated/bidStatistics.csv\n```\n\n### Bid details\n\nThe ```bids/details``` array is used to provide one or more ```Bid``` objects, each representing a unique bid received. \n\n```eval_rst\n.. extensiontable::\n   :extension: bids\n   :exclude_definitions: statistics BidsStatistic \n```\n\n#### Bid Status Codelist\n\n```eval_rst\n.. csv-table-no-translate::\n   :header-rows: 1\n   :file: codelists_translated/bidStatus.csv\n```\n\n### Example\n\nToDo\n",

In some systems and processes, a list of invited bidders will be published at the start of tendering, and full details and documents on the bids received may be disclosed when evaluation is complete. In other systems, only summary statistics on the number of bids received may be made public.\n\nThe OCDS bid extension introduces a new, flexible, top-level section to each contracting process to capture bidding information. Implementers will need to assess which fields are applicable to their local regulatory regime, and to local use-cases.\n\n## Bid Statistics\n\nThe `bids/bidStatistics` array can be used to represent key statistical information about the number of bids and bidders. Each entry in the array is a `BidsStatistic` object containing at least:\n\n* An identifier;\n* A measure, from the bidStatistics codelist;\n* A value for that measure;\n\n```eval_rst\n.. extensiontable::\n   :extension: bids\n   :definitions: BidsStatistic\n```\n\n### Bid Statistics Codelist\n\nThis is an **open** codelist. Publishers can add their own codes to this list. When doing so, publishers are encouraged to engage with the open contracting community to agree upon definitions of each code.\n\nFor example, publishers may wish to add statistics on minority or women owned businesses, or bids that meet certain environmental standards and targets.\n\n```eval_rst\n.. csv-table-no-translate::\n   :header-rows: 1\n   :file: codelists_translated/bidStatistics.csv\n```\n\n## Bid Details\n\nThe `bids/details` array is used to provide one or more `Bid` objects, each representing a unique bid received.\n\n```eval_rst\n.. extensiontable::\n   :extension: bids\n   :definitions: Bid\n```\n\n### Bid Status Codelist\n\n```eval_rst\n.. csv-table-no-translate::\n   :header-rows: 1\n   :file: codelists_translated/bidStatus.csv\n```\n\n## Example\n\nBelow is an example of a bids extension:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"bids\": {\n    \"statistics\": [{\n      \"id\": \"1.0\",\n      \"measure\": \"validBids\",\n      \"value\": 1,\n      \"date\": \"2016-12-09T01:00:00+01:00\",\n      \"notes\": \"This statistic covers the total number of unique bids received that were considered valid against relevant criteria.\"\n    }, {\n      \"id\": \"2.0\",\n      \"measure\": \"disqualifiedBids\",\n      \"value\": 1,\n      \"date\": \"2016-12-10T01:00:00+01:00\",\n      \"notes\": \"This statistic covers the total number of unique bids received that were disqualified.\"\n    }],\n    \"details\": [{\n      \"id\": \"1.0\",\n      \"date\": \"2016-12-09T01:00:00+01:00\",\n      \"status\": \"valid\",\n      \"value\": {\n        \"amount\": 1000,\n        \"currency\": \"USD\"\n      },\n      \"documents\": [{\n        \"id\": \"1.0\",\n        \"documentType\": \"evaluationReports\",\n        \"title\": \"Mega Consortium Bid Evaluation Report\",\n        \"description\": \"This document provides details of the evaluation of the bid submitted by Mega Consortium\",\n        \"url\": \"http://communications.gov.example/example_ppp/evaluationReport_megaConsortium.pdf\",\n        \"datePublished\": \"2016-11-17T10:00:00-06:00\",\n        \"format\": \"application/pdf\",\n        \"language\": \"en\",\n        \"author\": \"Ministry of Communications\"\n      }],\n      \"tenderers\": [{\n        \"id\": \"MEGA\",\n        \"name\": \"Mega Consortium\"\n      }]\n    }, {\n      \"id\": \"2.0\",\n      \"date\": \"2016-12-10T01:00:00+01:00\",\n      \"status\": \"disqualified\",\n      \"value\": {\n        \"amount\": 1500,\n        \"currency\": \"USD\"\n      },\n      \"documents\": [{\n        \"id\": \"1.0\",\n        \"documentType\": \"evaluationReports\",\n        \"title\": \"Beta Consortium Bid Evaluation Report\",\n        \"description\": \"This document provides details of the evaluation of the bid submitted by Beta Consortium\",\n        \"url\": \"http://communications.gov.example/example_ppp/evaluationReport_betaConsortium.pdf\",\n        \"datePublished\": \"2016-11-18T10:00:00-06:00\",\n        \"format\": \"application/pdf\",\n        \"language\": \"en\",\n        \"author\": \"Ministry of Communications\"\n      }],\n      \"tenderers\": [{\n        \"id\": \"BETA\",\n        \"name\": \"Beta Consortium\"\n      }]\n    }]\n\n  },\n  \"awards\": [{\n    \"id\": \"111\",\n    \"title\": \"Example PPP contract award\",\n    \"description\": \"Award of Example PPP contract to Mega Consortium\",\n    \"status\": \"active\",\n    \"date\": \"2016-12-17T10:00:00-06:00\",\n    \"relatedBid\": \"1.0\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n## Issues\n\nReport issues for this extension in the [ocds-extensions repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-extensions/issues), putting the extension's name in the issue's title.\n\n## Changelog\n\n### v1.1.3\n\n* Disallow required fields `BidsStatistic.id`, `BidsStatistic.measure`, `BidsStatistic.value` from being null\n* Disallow `Bids.statistics` from having null in its array of objects\n* Allow `Bids.statistics` to be null\n* Add enum to `BidsStatistic.status`\n* Move `BidsStatistic.requirementResponses` to requirements extension\n* Add descriptions to bidStatus.csv\n* List codelists in extension.json\n* Add example to documentation\n* Add tests and tidy code\n",

In the case of PPPs, budgets may be sourced from the private sector or from multi-lateral development banks.\n\nThis extension provides a way to describe multi-year and multi-source budgets.\n\nDisclosing structured data on multi-source budgets allows users to understand how much of the funds for a project come from government or from a specific department, whilst structured data on multi-year budgets allows users to understand the expected spend profile of a contract.\n\n## Extension fields\n\nThis extension adds a `budgetBreakdown` property to the `planning` section of OCDS. `budgetBreakdown` is an array of `budget` blocks.\n\nThis extension also extends the `budget` block with the following additional properties for use in the `budgetBreakdown` section:\n\n* `budget.sourceEntity` - an organization reference, linking to the entry in the `parties` section describing the organization providing the funds for this part of the budget\n* `budget.period` - a period block, describing the period to which this part of the budget applies\n\n## Guidance\n\nIn the core `planning.budget` block:\n\n* `budget.amount` should be used to capture the total value of the budget for the contracting process.\n* `budget.period` should be used to capture the total period over which the budget applies.\n* `budget.sourceEntity` should be omitted.\n\nWhere `budget.budgetBreakdown` is used to express a multi-source budget but the organization details are not known for one or more parts of the budget, for example in a PPP where part of the budget will be provided by the successful private sector bidder, the `sourceEntity.name` field should be used to provide a free text explanation of the source of the budget, e.g. \"Private sector investment from successful bidder\".\n\n## Examples\n\n### Multi-source budgets\n\nThe following JSON snippet models a single year multi-source budget:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"planning\": {\n    \"budget\": {\n      \"id\": \"1\",\n      \"description\": \"Multi-source budget, see budget breakdown for details.\",\n      \"amount\": {\n        \"amount\": 300000,\n        \"currency\": \"GBP\"\n      },\n      \"budgetBreakdown\": [\n        {\n          \"sourceParty\": {\n            \"id\": \"GB-LAC-E09000003-557\",\n            \"name\": \"London Borough of Barnet -

                            "content": "# Budget and projects extension\n\nIn the core OCDS, project information is nested within the `budget` building block. However, in some cases, budget management, and project management systems are separate, and it may be important to separately specify:\n\n* The amount reserved in the budget for a specific contracting process;\n\n* The project the contract relates to, and the total value of that project;\n\nThis is particularly important in cases of Public Private Partnership projects, or large infrastructure projects, where users may wish to track all the contracting processes related to a large-scale project, and to understand the individual contracts in the context of their contracting process and overall project values.\n\nThis extension introduces a `project` object into the `planning` section.\n\nIn the OCDS for PPPs profile, this is further extended with sector and location classifications.\n\n## Example\n\n```json\n{\n  \"planning\": {\n    \"project\": {\n      \"title\": \"Example PPP\",\n      \"description\": \"The Example PPP project will guarantee the installation of a wholesale shared network that allows the provision of telecommunications services by current and future operators.\",\n      \"id\": \"example_ppp\",\n      \"uri\": \"http://communications.gov.example/projects/example_ppp\",\n      \"totalValue\": {\n        \"amount\": 600000000,\n        \"currency\": \"USD\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe extension introduces the following fields:\n\n```eval_rst\n.. extensiontable::\n   :extension: budget_project\n   :exclude_definitions:\n```\n\n## Guidance\n\nUsers of this extension should follow the additional guidance below on the usage of fields which are also part of the core OCDS schema. The field's description from the core OCDS schema v1.1.3 is included for convenience; please refer to the [standard's documentation](http://standard.open-contracting.org) for more recent descriptions.\n\n```eval_rst\n.. list-table::\n    :header-rows: 1\n\n    * - Field\n      - OCDS schema description\n      - Extension guidance\n    * - ``planning/budget/id``\n      - An identifier for the budget line item which provides funds for this contracting process. This identifier should be possible to cross-reference against the provided data source.\n      - \"provided data source\" refers to formal budget documents.\n    * - ``planning/budget/description``\n      - A short free text description of the budget source. May be used to provide the title of the budget line, or the programme used to fund this project.\n      - This field may also be used to provide information about the nature of the budget allocation, e.g. conditional, confirmed, or any official authorizations given to the allocation.\n    * - ``planning/budget/amount``\n      - The value reserved in the budget for this contracting process. A negative value indicates anticipated income to the budget as a result of this contracting process, rather than expenditure. Where the budget is drawn from multiple sources, the budget breakdown extension can be used.\n      - Or, the value estimated for, or allocated to, this contracting process in a budget. This field should not be used to report the total value of the budget line funding this contracting process. The budget breakdown extension can be used for both multi-source and multi-year budgets.\n    * - ``planning/budget/project``\n      - The name of the project that through which this contracting process is funded (if applicable). Some organizations maintain a registry of projects, and the data should use the name by which the project is known in that registry. No translation option is offered for this string, as translated values can be provided in third-party data, linked from the data source above.\n      - Detailed information about the project which funds this contracting process should be provided in the ``planning/project`` object.\n    * - ``planning/budget/projectID``\n      - An external identifier for the project that this contracting process forms part of, or is funded via (if applicable). Some organizations maintain a registry of projects, and the data should use the identifier from the relevant registry of projects.\n      - This field is required for legacy compatibility with OCDS core.\n    * - ``planning/budget/uri``\n      - A URI pointing directly to a machine-readable record about the budget line-item or line-items that fund this contracting process. Information may be provided in a range of formats, including using IATI, the Open Fiscal Data Standard or any other standard which provides structured data on budget sources. Human readable documents can be included using the planning.documents block.\n      - Where possible, this URI should return machine *and* human-readable representations of budget data.\n```\n\n## Changelog\n\n### 2018-05-03\n\n* Add guidance section based on schema descriptions moved in previous update\n\n### 2017-12-29\n\n* Remove repeated descriptions for fields in OCDS core from extension schema\n\n### 2017-07-08\n\n* Updated version to maintain conformance with OCDS 1.1, removing the properties in the extension that deleted `planning/budget/project` and `planning/budget/projectID`.\n\n* Removing unnecessary mergeStrategy and pattern property schema elements\n\n## Issues\n\nReport issues for this extension in the [ocds-extensions repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-extensions/issues), putting the extension's name in the issue's title.\n",

The buyer is defined as the organizations whose funds are directly used for the purchase of the goods, works or services described in the contract.\n\nHowever, some forms of contracting process, such as framework agreements, may result in multiple contracts, with each contract signed by a different buyer.\n\nThis extension provides a way to provide `buyer` information on a per contract basis.\n\n## Extension fields\n\nThis extension adds a `buyer` property to the `contract` section of OCDS.\n\n`contract.buyer` is an `OrganizationReference` consisting of the following fields:\n\n* `name` - The name of the party being referenced. This must match the name of an entry in the `parties` section.\n* `id` - The id of the party being referenced. This must match the id of an entry in the `parties` section.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis extension is only valid from OCDS Version 1.1, as it makes use of the updated organization reference approach.\n\n## Example\n\n```json\n\"contracts\": [\n  {\n    \"id\": \"001\",\n    \"buyer\": {\n      \"name\": \"Example Department of Transport\",\n      \"id\": \"GB-GOV-00000000\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"002\",\n    \"buyer\": {\n      \"name\": \"Example Department of Education\",\n      \"id\": \"GB-GOV-12345678\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Issues\n\nReport issues for this extension in the [ocds-extensions repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-extensions/issues), putting the extension's name in the issue's title.\n",

There should be a presumption of 'open by default' when it comes to publishing these documents as part of an Open Contracting process.\n\nThe OCDS documentation block, which is used widely through the different sections of the standard, provides a means to link out to externally hosted documents.\n\nThese should generally be provided at their own stable URL, without requirements to log-in or authenticate. Redactions should be kept to a minimum.\n\n## Providing enhanced documentation and document links\n\nA number of implementations of OCDS, notable OCDS for PPPs, explicitly require a number of key items of information to be disclosed. These items are articulated as an extended list of entries for the `documentType` codelist.\n\nHowever, rather than just linking out to the entire document where the information is found, this extension describes a way to:\n\n* Summarize the information in the `description` field of the relevant document block;\n* Link to specific page numbers;\n* Describe any additional arrangements required to access the document or find the relevant information;\n* Record the author of the document;\n\nProviding clear summaries allows applications to display this information in a user-interface, allowing users to access key facts and justifications without clicking through to download and search for the information in a full document.\n\nLinking to the specific page where information is found supports quality assurance of disclosure.\n\nDescribing `accessDetails` for a document ensures that, even when documents are only accessible through attendance at a location (for example), that users can find how to discover them - and so that auditors can check documents have been made accessible in the appropriate ways.\n\nRecording the author of a document is important for checking whether there are potential conflicts of interest to be aware of: for example, when the author of a feasibility study is later involved in the team submitting a bid.\n\n## Extension fields\n\n```eval_rst\n.. extensiontable::\n   :extension: documentation_details\n```\n\n## Issues\n\nReport issues for this extension in the [ocds-extensions repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-extensions/issues), putting the extension's name in the issue's title.\n",

Will alternative proposals for the timeline be considered?\",\n      \"dateAnswered\":\"2017-02-05T09:00:00Z\",\n      \"answer\":\"There is a hard deadline of 15th April 2017. All proposals must be for delivery of Item 1 by this date.\",\n      \"relatedItem\":\"1\",\n      \"threadID\":\"1\"\n    }]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSupporting documents with clarifications, or a full document containing answers to questions can be included in the `tender/documents` array with a `documentType` of 'clarifications'.\n\nWhere the answers to a question are only available in attached documents, an `answer` value such as 'Consult section N of \"%document name%\" in the documents section' may be entered to allow analysts of the data to identify that an answer to this question has been provided.\n\nWhen a system allows a discussion format, where each answer can be followed by a further clarification question, the `threadID` property can be used to link together multiple entries in the `enquiries` array.\n\n## Usage guidance\n\nImplementations may vary on the amount of enquiry information they provide, and when it is provided.\n\nSome publishers may omit the identity of the question author to protect confidentiality of enquirers, or may anonymize this information (e.g. simply putting the author name as 'Organization 1' or 'Organization 2' so that it is possible to see questions from the same organization, but not to know the identity of that organization.)\n\nThe `relatedItem` and `relatedLot` properties are available for use when questions can be asked in relation to a specific lot or item.\n\nWhere possible, the recommended approach is to:\n\n* Make release with a `tenderUpdate` release tag for every new question or batch of questions received, providing an enquiries array with each of the questions in;\n* Make a release with a `tenderUpdate` release tag when the answers to the questions are provided, updating the earlier enquiries array so each entry now contains both a question and an answer;\n\nThis approach will enable third-party applications to watch for releases that provide answers to questions, and will support procurement monitors in reviewing the way in which questions are being answered.\n\nWe recommend that publishers provide question answers as plain text, or with minimal HTML markup (paragraphs and line-breaks), and that consuming applications parse text appropriately to format it for readability (e.g. replace line-breaks with paragraph breaks in HTML).\n\n## Reference\n\n```eval_rst\n.. extensiontable::\n   :extension: enquiries\n   :definitions: Enquiry\n```\n\n## Issues\n\nReport issues for this extension in the [ocds-extensions repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-extensions/issues), putting the extension's name in the issue's title.\n\n## Changelog\n\n### v1.1.3\n\n* Use `OrganizationReference` instead of `Organization` for `Enquiry.author`\n* Correct name of +partyRole.csv codelist (was +partyRoles.csv)\n* Allow `Enquiry.date` to be null\n* List codelists in extension.json\n* Use Apache 2.0 License\n* Add tests and tidy code\n",

In most cases, an update to the value or duration of a contract should be modelled as an amendment within a single entry in the contracts array.\n\n## Example\n\nThe extract below shows three contracts in the contracts array of an OCDS release.\n\nThe first two contracts were signed in 2011: one for one year for property rental, and the other for two years for services related to property rental.\n\nThe third contract was signed in 2012, and renews the property rental for another year. This is related back to the contract for the first year of rental with the `extendsContractID` property.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"contracts\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"207002-armin-hahner-stollmaier-21\",\n      \"awardID\": \"207002-armin-hahner-stollmaier-21\",\n      \"title\": \"Alquileres para la SNNA\",\n      \"status\": \"terminated\",\n      \"period\": {\n        \"startDate\": \"2011-01-02T23:59:59+00:00\",\n        \"endDate\": \"2012-01-02T23:59:59+00:00\"\n      },\n      \"value\": {\n        \"amount\": 1800000,\n        \"currency\": \"PYG\"\n      },\n      \"items\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"01\",\n          \"description\": \"Alquiler de Inmueble\",\n          \"classification\": {\n            \"scheme\": \"CPV\",\n            \"id\": \"70000000-1\",\n            \"description\": \"Real Estate Services\",\n            \"uri\": \"http://cpv.data.ac.uk/code-70000000\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"dateSigned\": \"2011-03-14T16:58:40+00:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"207004-armin-hahner-stollmaier-21-service\",\n      \"awardID\": \"207002-armin-hahner-stollmaier-21\",\n      \"title\": \"Servicios relacionados con alquileres para la SNNA\",\n      \"status\": \"active\",\n      \"period\": {\n        \"startDate\": \"2011-01-02T23:59:59+00:00\",\n        \"endDate\": \"2013-01-02T23:59:59+00:00\"\n      },\n      \"value\": {\n        \"amount\": 10000,\n        \"currency\": \"PYG\"\n      },\n      \"items\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"02\",\n          \"description\": \"Servicios relacionados con alquiler de Inmueble\",\n          \"classification\": {\n            \"scheme\": \"CPV\",\n            \"id\": \"70000000-1\",\n            \"description\": \"Real Estate Services\",\n            \"uri\": \"http://cpv.data.ac.uk/code-70000000\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"dateSigned\": \"2011-03-14T16:58:40+00:00\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"207002-armin-hahner-stollmaier-21-renovacion\",\n      \"awardID\": \"207002-armin-hahner-stollmaier-21\",\n      \"extendsContractID\": \"207002-armin-hahner-stollmaier\",\n      \"title\": \"Ad Referendum - Alquileres para la SNNA (Amends contract 207002)\",\n      \"status\": \"active\",\n      \"period\": {\n        \"startDate\": \"2012-01-02T23:59:59+00:00\",\n        \"endDate\": \"2013-01-02T23:59:59+00:00\"\n      },\n      \"value\": {\n        \"amount\": 12780000,\n        \"currency\": \"PYG\"\n      },\n      \"items\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"01\",\n          \"description\": \"Alquiler de Inmueble\",\n          \"classification\": {\n            \"scheme\": \"CPV\",\n            \"id\": \"70000000-1\",\n            \"description\": \"Real Estate Services\",\n            \"uri\": \"http://cpv.data.ac.uk/code-70000000\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"dateSigned\": \"2012-03-14T16:58:40+00:00\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe image below shows an example of how the information provided by the `extendsContractID` property is used in Paraguay, to display two contracts resulting from an award (the blue boxes), with one of those contracts then extended (the blue circle).\n\n![Paraguay Example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/342624/9915392/aecb1e52-5cae-11e5-9824-a6eb616e568b.png)\n\n## Issues\n\nReport issues for this extension in the [ocds-extensions repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-extensions/issues), putting the extension's name in the issue's title.\n",

This information can be updated over the lifetime of the contract.\n\nThe finance building block includes:\n\n* **Title** and **Description** - for providing summary information about the finance\n* **Financing Party** - an organization reference to the id and name of an organization listed in the main parties array.\n* **Finance Type** - an entry from a FinanceType codelist\n* **Finance Category** - an entry from a Finance Category codelist\n* **Step in arrangements** and **Exchange rate guarantee** flags, to indicate whether either apply to this finance\n* **Repayment Frequency** - to give an indication of likely repayments\n* **Period** - a start, end date and/or duration for the finance\n* **interestRate** - an object consisting of:\n  * **base** - a constant such as 0.1, or a known rate such as LIBOR\n  * **margin** - the component added to this base to give the rate\n  * **fixed** - a boolean for whether the rate is fixed or variable\n  * **notes** - space to provide more information on the rate\n\nThis allows modelling of rates such as 'LIBOR+1%'.\n\n## Codelists\n\nThe 'financeType' codelist is based on the list on [Page 57 of the World Bank PPP Disclosure Framework](http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/143671469558797229/FrameworkPPPDisclosure-071416.pdf#page=57)\n\nThe 'financeCategory' codelist is used to indicate (a) the rights attached to finance (in terms of equity, mezzanine and senior loans), and (b) to distinguish direct finance from guarantees.\n\n## Issues\n\nReport issues for this extension in the [ocds-extensions repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-extensions/issues), putting the extension's name in the issue's title.\n\n## Changelog\n\n2018-05-08 - Make `finance/id` required and non-nullable to support revision tracking and [list merging](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/schema/merging/#lists).\n",

This information can be updated over the lifetime of the contract.\n\nThe finance building block includes:\n\n* **Title** and **Description** - for providing summary information about the finance\n* **Financing Party** - an organization reference to the id and name of an organisation listed in the main parties array. \n* **Finance Type** - an entry from a FinanceType codelist\n* **Finance Category** - an entry from a Finance Category codelist\n* **Step in arrangements** and **Exchange rate guarantee** flags, to indicate whether either apply to this finance\n* **Repayment Frequency** - to give an indication of likely repayments\n* **Period** - a start, end date and/or duration for the finance\n* **interestRate** - an object consisting of:\n  * **base** - a constant such as 0.1, or a known rate such as LIBOR\n  * **margin** - the component added to this base to give the rate\n  * **fixed** - a boolean for whether the rate is fixed or variable\n  * **notes** - space to provide more information on the rate\n\nThis allows modelling of rates such as 'LIBOR+1%'. \n\n## Codelists\n\nThe 'financeType' codelist is based on the list on [Page 57 of the World Bank PPP Disclosure Framework](http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/143671469558797229/FrameworkPPPDisclosure-071416.pdf#page=57)\n\nThe 'financeCategory' codelist is used to indicate (a) the rights attached to finance (in terms of equity, mezzanine and senior loans), and (b) to distinguish direct finance from guarantees. \n\n",

                            "content": "# Lots\n\nWhen a single tender is broken down into parts that can be bid upon, and awarded, separately, this is modelled using the **lots extension**.\n\nThe lots extension maintains the overall structure of an OCDS release, with items, documents and milestones nested immediately within `tender`, `award` and `contract` items, but it introduces an array of Lots in the `tender` section, and the ability to cross-reference a specific `relatedLot` for each item, and an array of `relatedLots` for documents, milestones and awards.\n\nOptional `lotDetails` and `lotGroups` section allow more complex conditions around the award of lots to be expressed, such as the maximum value of a group of lots.\n\nThis means that systems which are not 'lot aware' can still understand the overall value of contracting taking place, key events, and relationships between buyers and suppliers. At the same time, 'lot aware' systems can make use of the cross-referenced information to present a lot-centric view on the information to users, or to analyze contracting lot by lot.\n\n## Related Lot\n\nThe `relatedLot` (singular) property is available for:\n\n* items\n\nAn array of `relatedLots` (plural) can be provided for each of:\n\n* documents\n* milestones\n* awards\n\nWhen lots are used, **all** items should have a `relatedLot` property.\n\nDocuments and milestones can optionally have a `relatedLots` property. Those without this property should be interpreted as applicable to the tender as a whole.\n\nThe items within an award should each have a `relatedLot` property, but publishers may choose to also reference all the lots an award relates to at the award level using `relatedLots`.\n\nWhere the bid extension is also in use, each bid can also declare its related lots.\n\n## Worked example\n\nA tender is issued for consultancy in the development of a new public building. This might include items for:\n\n* Architectural design\n* Architectural advisory services\n* Civil engineering consultancy\n* Structural engineering consultancy\n\nAlthough part of the same tender, the buyer is willing to award these different items to different firms, and so divides the tender into three lots.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"publishedDate\": \"2017-02-08T14:00:00Z\",\n  \"publisher\": {\n

At the same time, 'lot aware' systems can make use of the cross-referenced information to present a lot-centric view on the information to users, or to analyse contracting lot by lot. \n\n## Related Lot\n\nThe ```relatedLot``` (singular) property is available for:\n\n* items \n\nAn array of ```relatedLots``` (plural) can be provided for each of:\n\n* documents\n* milestones\n* awards \n\nWhen lots are used, **all** items should have a ```relatedLot``` property.\n\nDocuments and milestones can optionally have a ```relatedLots``` property. Those without this property should be interpreted as applicable to the tender as a whole. \n\nThe items within an award should each have a ```relatedLot``` property, but publishers may choose to also reference all the lots an award relates to at the award level using ```relatedLots```\n\nWhere the bid extension is also in use, each bid can also declare its related lots. \n\n## Worked example\n\nA tender is issued for consultancy in the development of a new public building. This might include items for:\n\n* Architectural design\n* Architectural advisory services\n* Civil engineering consultancy\n* Structural engineering consultancy\n\nAlthough part of the same tender, the buyer is willing to award these different items to different firms, and so divides the tender into three lots. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"publishedDate\": \"2017-02-08T14:00:00Z\",\n  \"publisher\": {\n    \"scheme\": \"GB-COH\",\n    \"uid\": \"09506232\",\n    \"name\": \"Open Data Services Co-operative Limited\",\n    \"uri\": \"http://standard.open-contracting.org/examples/\"\n  },\n  \"license\": \"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/\",\n  \"publicationPolicy\": \"https://github.com/open-contracting/sample-data/\",\n  \"releases\": [\n    {\n      \"language\": \"en\",\n      \"ocid\": \"ocds-213czf-lots-00001\",\n      \"id\": \"ocds-213czf-lots-00001-01-tender\",\n      \"date\": \"2017-02-08T14:00:00Z\",\n      \"tag\": [\n        \"tender\"\n      ],\n      \"initiationType\": \"tender\",\n      \"buyer\": {\n          \"id\": \"ZZ-MISC-anytown\",\n          \"name\": \"AnyTown Council \"\n      },\n      \"tender\": {\n        \"id\": \"ocds-213czf-lots-00001-01-tender\",\n        \"title\": \"Architecture and engineeering services\",\n        \"description\": \"The authority is seeking support to construct a new public building.\",\n        \"procurementMethod\": \"open\",\n        \"status\": \"active\",\n        \"items\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": \"0001\",\n            \"description\": \"Architectural advice\",\n            \"classification\": {\n              \"scheme\": \"CPV\",\n              \"id\": \"71210000\",\n              \"description\": \"Advisory architectural services\"\n            },\n            \"relatedLot\":\"lot-1\"\n           },\n           {\n            \"id\": \"0002\",\n            \"description\": \"Architectural design\",\n            \"classification\": {\n              \"scheme\": \"CPV\",\n              \"id\": \"71220000\",\n              \"description\": \"Architectural design services\"\n            },\n            \"relatedLot\":\"lot-1\"\n           },\n           {\n            \"id\": \"0003\",\n            \"description\": \"Civil engineering consultant\",\n            \"classification\": {\n              \"scheme\": \"CPV\",\n              \"id\": \"71311000\",\n              \"description\": \"Civil engineering consultancy services\"\n            },\n            \"relatedLot\":\"lot-2\"\n           },\n           {\n            \"id\": \"0004\",\n            \"description\": \"Structural engineering services\",\n            \"classification\": {\n              \"scheme\": \"CPV\",\n              \"id\": \"71312000\",\n              \"description\": \"Structural engineering consultancy services\"\n            },\n            \"relatedLot\":\"lot-1\"\n           }\n        ],\n        \"value\": {\n          \"amount\": 1200000,\n          \"currency\": \"GBP\"\n        },\n        \"lots\":[\n            {\n                \"id\":\"lot-1\",\n                \"title\":\"Architectural services\",\n                \"description\":\"For architectural services delivered in the project\",\n                \"status\":\"active\",\n                \"value\":{\n                    \"currency\":\"GBP\",\n                    \"amount\":200000\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\":\"lot-2\",\n                \"title\":\"Civil engineering services\",\n                \"description\":\"For civil engineering services delivered in the project\",\n                \"status\":\"active\",\n                \"value\":{\n                    \"currency\":\"GBP\",\n                    \"amount\":600000\n                }\n            }\n            ,{\n                \"id\":\"lot-3\",\n                \"title\":\"Structural engineering\",\n                \"description\":\"For structural engineering consultancy delivered in the project\",\n                \"status\":\"active\",\n                \"value\":{\n                    \"currency\":\"GBP\",\n                    \"amount\":600000\n                }\n            }\n        ],\n        \"lotGroups\":[{\n            \"id\":\"lot-group-1\",\n            \"relatedLots\":[\"lot-2\",\"lot-3\"],\n            \"optionToCombine\":true,\n            \"maximumValue\":1000000\n        }],\n        \"lotDetails\":{\n            \"maximumLotsBidPerSupplier\":4,\n            \"maximumLotsAwardedPerSupplier\":2\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Schema\n\n```eval_rst\n.. extensiontable::\n    :extension: lots\n    :definitions: Lots\n```",

At the same time, 'lot aware' systems can make use of the cross-referenced information to present a lot-centric view on the information to users, or to analyze contracting lot by lot.\n\n## Related Lot\n\nThe ```relatedLot``` (singular) property is available for:\n\n* items\n\nAn array of ```relatedLots``` (plural) can be provided for each of:\n\n* documents\n* milestones\n* awards\n\nWhen lots are used, **all** items should have a ```relatedLot``` property.\n\nDocuments and milestones can optionally have a ```relatedLots``` property. Those without this property should be interpreted as applicable to the tender as a whole.\n\nThe items within an award should each have a ```relatedLot``` property, but publishers may choose to also reference all the lots an award relates to at the award level using ```relatedLots```\n\nWhere the bid extension is also in use, each bid can also declare its related lots.\n\n## Worked example\n\nA tender is issued for consultancy in the development of a new public building. This might include items for:\n\n* Architectural design\n* Architectural advisory services\n* Civil engineering consultancy\n* Structural engineering consultancy\n\nAlthough part of the same tender, the buyer is willing to award these different items to different firms, and so divides the tender into three lots.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"publishedDate\": \"2017-02-08T14:00:00Z\",\n  \"publisher\": {\n    \"scheme\": \"GB-COH\",\n    \"uid\": \"09506232\",\n    \"name\": \"Open Data Services Co-operative Limited\",\n    \"uri\": \"http://standard.open-contracting.org/examples/\"\n  },\n  \"license\": \"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/\",\n  \"publicationPolicy\": \"https://github.com/open-contracting/sample-data/\",\n  \"uri\": \"https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds_lots_extension/blob/master/examples/lots.json\",\n  \"extensions\":[\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-contracting/ocds_lots_extension/v1.1/extension.json\"],\n  \"version\": \"1.1\",\n  \"releases\": [\n    {\n      \"language\": \"en\",\n      \"ocid\": \"ocds-213czf-lots-00001\",\n      \"id\": \"ocds-213czf-lots-00001-01-tender\",\n      \"date\": \"2017-02-08T14:00:00Z\",\n      \"tag\": [\n        \"tender\"\n      ],\n      \"initiationType\": \"tender\",\n      \"buyer\": {\n          \"id\": \"ZZ-MISC-anytown\",\n          \"name\": \"AnyTown Council \"\n      },\n      \"tender\": {\n        \"id\": \"ocds-213czf-lots-00001-01-tender\",\n        \"title\": \"Architecture and engineering services\",\n        \"description\": \"The authority is seeking support to construct a new public building.\",\n        \"procurementMethod\": \"open\",\n        \"status\": \"active\",\n        \"items\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": \"0001\",\n            \"description\": \"Architectural advice\",\n            \"classification\": {\n              \"scheme\": \"CPV\",\n              \"id\": \"71210000\",\n              \"description\": \"Advisory architectural services\"\n            },\n            \"relatedLot\":\"lot-1\"\n           },\n           {\n            \"id\": \"0002\",\n            \"description\": \"Architectural design\",\n            \"classification\": {\n              \"scheme\": \"CPV\",\n              \"id\": \"71220000\",\n              \"description\": \"Architectural design services\"\n            },\n            \"relatedLot\":\"lot-1\"\n           },\n           {\n            \"id\": \"0003\",\n            \"description\": \"Civil engineering consultant\",\n            \"classification\": {\n              \"scheme\": \"CPV\",\n              \"id\": \"71311000\",\n              \"description\": \"Civil engineering consultancy services\"\n            },\n            \"relatedLot\":\"lot-2\"\n           },\n           {\n            \"id\": \"0004\",\n            \"description\": \"Structural engineering services\",\n            \"classification\": {\n              \"scheme\": \"CPV\",\n              \"id\": \"71312000\",\n              \"description\": \"Structural engineering consultancy services\"\n            },\n            \"relatedLot\":\"lot-1\"\n           }\n        ],\n        \"value\": {\n          \"amount\": 1200000,\n          \"currency\": \"GBP\"\n        },\n        \"lots\":[\n            {\n                \"id\":\"lot-1\",\n                \"title\":\"Architectural services\",\n                \"description\":\"For architectural services delivered in the project\",\n                \"status\":\"active\",\n                \"value\":{\n                    \"currency\":\"GBP\",\n                    \"amount\":200000\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\":\"lot-2\",\n                \"title\":\"Civil engineering services\",\n                \"description\":\"For civil engineering services delivered in the project\",\n                \"status\":\"active\",\n                \"value\":{\n                    \"currency\":\"GBP\",\n                    \"amount\":600000\n                }\n            }\n            ,{\n                \"id\":\"lot-3\",\n                \"title\":\"Structural engineering\",\n                \"description\":\"For structural engineering consultancy delivered in the project\",\n                \"status\":\"active\",\n                \"value\":{\n                    \"currency\":\"GBP\",\n                    \"amount\":600000\n                }\n            }\n        ],\n        \"lotGroups\":[{\n            \"id\":\"lot-group-1\",\n            \"relatedLots\":[\"lot-2\",\"lot-3\"],\n            \"optionToCombine\":true,\n            \"maximumValue\":{\n              \"currency\":\"GBP\",\n              \"amount\":1000000\n            }\n        }],\n        \"lotDetails\":{\n            \"maximumLotsBidPerSupplier\":4,\n            \"maximumLotsAwardedPerSupplier\":2\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Schema\n\n```eval_rst\n.. extensiontable::\n    :extension: lots\n    :definitions: Lots\n```\n",

At the same time, 'lot aware' systems can make use of the cross-referenced information to present a lot-centric view on the information to users, or to analyze contracting lot by lot.\n\n## Related Lot\n\nThe `relatedLot` (singular) property is available for:\n\n* items\n\nAn array of `relatedLots` (plural) can be provided for each of:\n\n* documents\n* milestones\n* awards\n\nWhen lots are used, **all** items should have a `relatedLot` property.\n\nDocuments and milestones can optionally have a `relatedLots` property. Those without this property should be interpreted as applicable to the tender as a whole.\n\nThe items within an award should each have a `relatedLot` property, but publishers may choose to also reference all the lots an award relates to at the award level using `relatedLots`.\n\nWhere the bid extension is also in use, each bid can also declare its related lots.\n\n## Worked example\n\nA tender is issued for consultancy in the development of a new public building. This might include items for:\n\n* Architectural design\n* Architectural advisory services\n* Civil engineering consultancy\n* Structural engineering consultancy\n\nAlthough part of the same tender, the buyer is willing to award these different items to different firms, and so divides the tender into three lots.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"publishedDate\": \"2017-02-08T14:00:00Z\",\n  \"publisher\": {\n

                            "content": "# Metrics Extension\n\nThe metrics extension provides a common building block for reporting structured performance information on contracts.\n\nMetrics are structured like an [OLAP data cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLAP_cube) with each instance of `Metric` representing a single **observation**, categorized by a number of **dimensions**.\n\nThe metrics extension can be used at:\n\n* The `planning` stage for forecasts for the contracting process (e.g. forecast demand levels)\n* The `tender` stage for targets for the contracting process (e.g. target availability levels or KPIs)\n* The `award` and `contract` stages for targets agreed with the successful supplier (e.g. availability levels or KPIs)\n* The `implementation` stage for actual performance information (e.g. actual demand, availability, KPIs etc.)\n\nWhere the metrics extension is used to model targets for a contracting process, the `description` field can be used to start whether the target is a minimum or recommended target.\n\n## Example - Forecasts\n\n```json\n{\n  \"forecasts\":[\n    {\n      \"id\":\"annualDemand\",\n      \"title\":\"Annual Demand\",\n      \"description\":\"The annual demand\",\n      \"observations\":[\n        {\n          \"period\":{\n            \"startDate\":\"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\n            \"endDate\":\"2015-12-31T23:59:59Z\"\n          },\n          \"quantity\":\"10000\",\n          \"dimensions\":{\n            \"vehicleType\":\"Car\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"period\":{\n            \"startDate\":\"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\n            \"endDate\":\"2015-12-31T23:59:59Z\"\n          },\n          \"quantity\":\"1000\",\n          \"dimensions\":{\n            \"vehicleType\":\"Trucks\"\n          },\n          \"note\":\"Simple note\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Example - Physical progress\n\nThe metrics extension can also be used to report on the physical progress of a contract. The following JSON snippet shows how the metrics extension could be used to report on progress for the construction of a highway, both by percent completion and number of kilometres constructed:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"implementation\": {\n    \"metrics\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"completionPercent\",\n        \"title\": \"Construction progress (percent)\",\n        \"description\": \"Percent completion of the construction of example highway\",\n        \"observations\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": \"completionPercent-2016-Q1\",\n            \"period\": {\n              \"startDate\": \"2016-03-31T23:59:59Z\",\n              \"endDate\": \"2016-03-31T23:59:59Z\"\n            },\n            \"measure\": \"25\",\n            \"unit\": {\n              \"name\": \"percent\",\n              \"id\": \"P1\",\n              \"scheme\": \"UNCEFACT\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"completionKilometres\",\n        \"title\": \"Construction progress (kilometres)\",\n        \"description\": \"Progress of construction of example highway measured in kilometres\",\n        \"observations\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": \"completionKilometres-2016-Q1\",\n            \"period\": {\n              \"startDate\": \"2016-03-31T23:59:59Z\",\n              \"endDate\": \"2016-03-31T23:59:59Z\"\n            },\n            \"measure\": \"15\",\n            \"unit\": {\n              \"name\": \"kilometre\",\n              \"id\": \"KMT\",\n              \"scheme\": \"UNCEFACT\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Use with requirements\n\nMetrics can be used along with the **requirements extension** which will add a 'relatedRequirementID' property to metrics.\n\nWith the requirements extension, bids, awards and contracts can include a `RequirementResponse` indicating the values against each metric that a supplier intends to meet.\n\nThis can allow a degree of comparison between performance anticipated at bid, award, contract and implementation phases.\n\n## To Do\n\n* [ ] Check oneOf schema syntax for value **or** quantity\n* [ ] Add relatedRequirementID to requirements extension\n* [ ] Validate schema updates\n\n## Issues\n\nReport issues for this extension in the [ocds-extensions repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-extensions/issues), putting the extension's name in the issue's title.\n",

For example, sometimes a document fee is only applicable to the hard copy of the documents.\n* `methodOfPayment` - an optional field providing information on methods of payment accepted for the documentation. This is currently an array of strings, but an open codelist may be introduced in future.\n\n## Extension codelists\n\nThis extension adds **closed** `participationFeeType` codelist with the following codes:\n\n* document - a fee payable for access to bidding documents\n* deposit - a refundable fee payable for the submission of bids\n* submission - a non-refundable fee payable for the submission of bids\n* win - a fee payable by the winning bidder\n\n## Example\n\nThe following JSON snippet models a contracting process where fees are applicable for both access to documents and submission of bids:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tender\": {\n    \"participationFees\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"document\",\n        \"value\": {\n          \"currency\": \"GBP\",\n          \"amount\": 8.00\n        },\n        \"description\": \"Fee payable for both soft and hard copies of documents.\",\n          \"methodOfPayment\":[\"electronic\",\"cheque\"]\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": [\"submission\"],\n        \"value\": {\n          \"currency\": \"GBP\",\n          \"amount\": 10.00\n        },\n        \"description\": \"Fee payable within e-procurement system.\",\n        \"methodOfPayment\":[\"electronic\"]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage notes\n\nIn some cases, a fee may be levied for 'official copies' of procurement documents (although copies may also be available freely online), and bidders required to prove they have paid for an official copy of the documents as part of their submission.\n\nIn this case, the fee should be modelled as a **submission** fee, as submission is only possible when this document access fee has been paid.\n\n## Issues\n\nReport issues for this extension in the [ocds-extensions repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-extensions/issues), putting the extension's name in the issue's title.\n\n## Changelog\n\n### v1.1.3\n\n* Disallow `ParticipationFee.type` from having null in its array of strings\n* Allow `ParticipationFee.description` to be null\n* Add `ParticipationFee.id` field\n* Add description to `ParticipationFee`\n* Add title and description to `ParticipationFee.value`\n* Add participationFeeType.csv codelist for `ParticipationFee.type`\n* Add tests and tidy code\n",

For example, sometimes a document fee is only applicable to the hard copy of the documents.\n* ```methodOfPayment``` - an optional field providing information on methods of payment accepted for the documentation.

For example, sometimes a document fee is only applicable to the hard copy of the documents.\n* `methodOfPayment` - an optional field providing information on methods of payment accepted for the documentation. This is currently an array of strings, but an open codelist may be introduced in future.\n\n## Extension codelists\n\nThis extension adds **closed** `participationFeeType` codelist with the following codes:\n\n* document - a fee payable for access to bidding documents\n* deposit - a refundable fee payable for the submission of bids\n* submission - a non-refundable fee payable for the submission of bids\n* win - a fee payable by the winning bidder\n\n## Example\n\nThe following JSON snippet models a contracting process where fees are applicable for both access to documents and submission of bids:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"tender\": {\n    \"participationFees\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"document\",\n        \"value\": {\n          \"currency\": \"GBP\",\n          \"amount\": 8.00\n        },\n        \"description\": \"Fee payable for both soft and hard copies of documents.\",\n          \"methodOfPayment\":[\"electronic\",\"cheque\"]\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": [\"submission\"],\n        \"value\": {\n          \"currency\": \"GBP\",\n          \"amount\": 10.00\n        },\n        \"description\": \"Fee payable within e-procurement system.\",\n        \"methodOfPayment\":[\"electronic\"]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage notes\n\nIn some cases, a fee may be levied for 'official copies' of procurement documents (although copies may also be available freely online), and bidders required to prove they have paid for an official copy of the documents as part of their submission.\n\nIn this case, the fee should be modelled as a **submission** fee, as submission is only possible when this document access fee has been paid.\n\n## Issues\n\nReport issues for this extension in the [ocds-extensions repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-extensions/issues), putting the extension's name in the issue's title.\n\n## Changelog\n\n### v1.1.3\n\n* Disallow `ParticipationFee.type` from having null in its array of strings\n* Allow `ParticipationFee.description` to be null\n* Add `ParticipationFee.id` field\n* Add description to `ParticipationFee`\n* Add title and description to `ParticipationFee.value`\n* Add participationFeeType.csv codelist for `ParticipationFee.type`\n* Add tests and tidy code\n",

It adds support for the detailed classification of one or more of the organizations included in an OCDS contracting process release.\n\nThe `scale` field should be included in a release at `parties/details/scale`.\n\n## Scale\n\nThe `scale` property can be used to indicate the size or scale of a commercial organization.\n\nThis is a metric used by a number of procurement statistics. For example, to calculate the share of procurement going to micro, small or medium enterprises.\n\nThe extension uses a fixed codelist with the following values:\n\n* micro\n* sme\n* large\n\nThe extension does not define these terms. The exact definition of each is to be provided by the publishing organization, and in general should be the definition used in the law or regulations of the procuring entity or buyer.\n\nLaws and regulations vary as to the exact definition of these terms. The OECD [provide a relevant glossary definition here](https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=3123).\n\n## Example\n\nThe following example shows the location where the partyScale extension can be used.\n\n```json\n{\n\"releases\":[\n    {\n       \"parties\":[\n          {\n            \"id\": \"GB-COH-1234567844\",\n            \"name\": \"AnyCorp Cycle Provision\",\n            \"details\":{\n               \"scale\":\"sme\"\n            }\n          }\n       ]\n    }\n]\n}\n```\n\n## Issues\n\nReport issues for this extension in the [ocds-extensions repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-extensions/issues), putting the extension's name in the issue's title.\n",

The `PerformanceFailure` object has the following properties:\n\n* `period` - an OCDS `period` object defining the reporting period to applicable to the performance failures being reported\n* `category` - a free text field used to describe the category of performance failures being reported\n* `events` - a number field used to state the number of performance failure events in the period and category being reported\n* `penaltyContracted` - a free text field used to describe the penalty or abatement defined in the contract for the number, category and period of performance failures being reported\n* `penaltyImposed` - a free text field used to describe the penalty or abatement actually imposed for the number, category and period of performance failures being reported\n* `penaltyPaid` - a boolean field indicating whether the penalty imposed has been paid. A value of `true` indicates that the penalty has been paid\n\n## Example\n\nThe following JSON snippet models the performance failures reported for a single period and category.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"implementation\": {\n    \"performanceFailures\": [\n      {\n        \"period\": {\n          \"startDate\": \"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\n          \"endDate\": \"2016-12-31T23:59:59Z\"\n        },\n        \"category\": \"Daily average journey time exceeds 10 minutes\",\n        \"events\": 73,\n        \"penaltyContracted\": \"If the daily average journey time exceeds 10 minutes on more than 52 days per calendar year the project company will be subject to a penalty charge equal to (days - 52) * avgToll. Where days is the total number of days where the average journey time exceeded 10 minutes and avgToll is the average daily toll revenue to the project company over the calendar year in which the failures occurred.\",\n        \"penaltyImposed\": \"A penalty of \u00a33,360,000 was imposed\",\n        \"penaltyPaid\": true\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Notes\n\n## To do\n\n* Add a `relatedTransactions` reference to the performance failure object?\n\n## Issues\n\nReport issues for this extension in the [ocds-extensions repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-extensions/issues), putting the extension's name in the issue's title.\n\n## Changelog\n\n2018-05-08 - Make `performanceFailure/id` required to support revision tracking and [list merging](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/schema/merging/#lists).\n",

                            "content": "## OCDS for Public Private Partnerships\n\nThe Open Contracting Data Standard for Public Private Partnerships profile provides an extended Open Contracting Data Standard schema, offering a structured data model for presenting information on Public Private Partnership Projects.\n\nIt is based on the [World Bank Framework for Disclosure in Public Private Patnership Projects](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/publicprivatepartnerships/brief/ppp-tools#T1) and was developed between May 2016 and May 2017 through a partnership between the [World Bank Open Contracting team](https://blogs.worldbank.org/category/tags/open-contracting), [PPP team](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/publicprivatepartnerships), [Open Contracting Partnership](http://open-contracting.org), and [Open Data Services Co-operative](http://www.opendataservices.coop). \n\nFull documentation of the profile is available at [http://standard.open-contracting.org/profiles/ppp/](http://standard.open-contracting.org/profiles/ppp/)\n\nThe consolidated OCDS for PPPs extension can be declared in [OCDS package metadata](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/schema/release_package/) using:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"extensions\":[\"http://standard.open-contracting.org/profiles/ppp/schema/1__0__0__beta/extension.json\"],\n    \"releases\":[]\n}\n```\n\n## About PPP extensions \n\nOCDS for PPPs is constructed from [a number of different modular extensions to OCDS](http://standard.open-contracting.org/profiles/ppp/latest/en/extensions/), most of which can be used independently from the profile.\n\nThis repository contains one additional extensions that forms part of the OCDS for PPPs profile. This extension introduces a number of fields and building blocks that are specific to PPP disclosure against the World Bank Framework, as well as a set of modifications that should only apply in an OCDS Profile (e.g. removing standard fields that are not required in the profile). \n\n### PPP Specific extensions \n\n#### Project level information\n\nBuilding on the [Budget and Projects extension](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds_budget_projects_extension) this adds to project with:\n\n* Sector classifications - using the [UN Classifications of the Functions of Government](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=4)\n* Additional classifications - allowing arbitrary additional project categorization\n* Project location - with options for gazetteer or point location\n\nAn example is shown below:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"releases\":[\n        {\n            \"planning\": {\n                \"project\": {\n                                    \"sector\": {\n                                        \"scheme\": \"COFOG\",\n                                        \"description\": \"Road transportation\",\n                                        \"id\": \"04.5.1\"\n                                    },\n                                    \"locations\": [\n                                        {\n                                            \"description\": \"Local Authority Area: Halton Borough Council\",\n                                            \"gazetteer\": {\n                                                \"scheme\": \"GEONAMES\",\n                                                \"identifiers\": \"2647601.0\"\n                                            }\n                                        }\n                                    ]\n                                }\n                            }\n                  }\n\n        ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Evaluation Indicators\n\nThe PPP disclosure framework calls for a number of different indicators to be reported relating to governments evaluation of a PPP project.\n\nThe `award/evaluationIndicators` section includes properties to express the **value** and supporting **free-text details** for each indicator:\n\n* discountRate\n* riskPremium\n* netPresentValue\n\n#### Finance Summary\n\nThe PPP disclosure framework calls for a number of different indicators relating to the financial model of a PPP project. Whilst some of these may be reported as metrics on an ongoing basis, some are simple single values.\n\nThe `contract/financeSummary` section includes properties to express the **value** and supporting **free-text details** for each indicator:\n\n* debtEquityRatio\n* shareCapital\n* subsidyRatio\n* projectIRR\n\n#### Removals\n\nA standard OCDS extension should not remove content from the OCDS schema. However, to allow us to generate a profile schema and reference pages that contain **only** fields that should be considered when publishing OCDS for PPPs data, the release-schema.json for this extension contains a number of `null` fields, which remove schema elements not used by OCDS for PPPs. \n\nThis includes elements deprecated in OCDS 1.0, or procurement specific elements that don't apply in a PPP context. \n\n## Issues\n\nReport issues for this extension in the [ocds-extensions repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-extensions/issues), putting the extension's name in the issue's title.\n",

                            "content": "# Requirements\n\nThe requirements extension is based on the EU's [Core Criterion and Core Evidence Vocabulary (CCCEV)](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/node/153001) model for communicating criteria and responses.\n\nThe extension is designed to allow procuring entities or buyers to express criteria, relating to either items being procured or bidders themselves, as structured data.\n\nCriteria can be responded to either by bidders, buyers or procuring entities, for example a buyer may respond with information about an item whilst a procuring entity may respond with information on whether a bidder is disbarred.\n\n## CCCEV Model\n\nThe CCCEV model defines the following concepts:\n\n**Criterion**\nA criterion represents a rule or principle used to judge, evaluate or assess either an item or bidder. A criterion is satisfied when one or more of it's requirement groups are satisfied.\n\n**Requirement Group**\nA requirement group is a collection of one or more individual requirements. A requirement group is satisfied when all of it's requirements are satisfied.\n\n**Requirement**\nAn atomic requirement which can be expressed as either an expected value or a range of accepted values.\n\n**Requirement Response**\nA requirements response is an assertion that responds to a specific requirement.\n\nTherefore the CCCEV model can be used to express both **AND** conditions, where a group of requirements must be met to satisfy a criterion, and **OR** conditions, where there are alternative requirements that can satisfy a criterion.\n\n## Schema\n\nThe extension introduces a new building block for each of the concepts described above, these are added to the following locations in the OCDS schema:\n\n- *tender.criteria* - an array of criteria\n- *tender.criteria.requirementGroups* - an array of requirement groups\n- *tender.criteria.requirementGroups.requirements* - an array of requirements\n- *bids.requirementResponses* - an array of requirement responses (Note: depends on *bid* extension)\n- *awards.requirementResponses* - an array of requirements responses\n- *contracts.requirementResponses* - an array or requirement responses\n\n## Background\n\nThere are number of scenarios in which structured information on requirements is necessary. See discussion in GitHub issue [#223](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/223).\n\n## Example usage\n\nBelow is an example of requirements specified against both an item and a bidder which demonstrates both **AND** and **OR** conditions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tender\": {\n    \"criteria\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"0001\",\n        \"title\": \"Air intake\",\n

criteria are derived, **evidence**, used both to specify and provide the evidence required to support a requirement response, and additional properties of *requirements* such as **certificationLevel** which are not currently implemented in this extension.\n\n## Outstanding issues\n\nThe extension does not describe formulae for calculated computed values.\n\nThe extension does not describe whether

This is particularly important where bidders are consortia.\n\nThe extension introduces a new `Shareholder` building block and extends the `Organization` building block with a new `shareholders` field.\n\n## Shareholders Field\n\nThe `Organization/shareholders` field is an array of `Shareholder` building blocks, describing the shareholders for the organization.\n\n## Shareholder Building Block\n\nThe shareholder building block provides a way to:\n\n* Link to the organization details of the shareholder\n* Describe the amount of shares held by the shareholder\n* Describe the voting rights associated with the shareholding\n\n```eval_rst\n.. extensiontable::\n   :extension: shareholders\n```\n\n\n"

This is particularly important where bidders are consortia.\n\nThe extension introduces a new ```shareholder``` building block and extends the ```organization``` building block with a new ```shareholders``` field.\n\n## Shareholders Field\n\nThe ```organization/shareholders``` field is an array of ```shareholder``` building blocks, describing the shareholders for the organization. \n\n## Shareholder Building Block\n\nThe shareholder building block provides a way to:\n\n* Link to the organization details of the shareholder\n* Describe the amount of shares held by the shareholder\n* Describe the voting rights assoicated with the shareholding\n\n```eval_rst\n.. extensiontable::\n   :extension: shareholders\n```\n\n\n"

Instead the contract signatories are implicitly assumed to be the `buyer` defined at release level (known as the `publicAuthority` in the PPP extension) and the `suppliers` listed in the `award` associated with the contract (known as the `preferredBidders` in the PPP extension).\n\nIn some types of contracting process there may be additional signatories to the contract or the signatories to the contract may differ from those specified in `buyer` / `publicAuthority` and `award/suppliers` / `award/preferredBidders`.\n\n## Extension fields\n\nThis extension adds a `signatories` property to the `contract` section. The `signatories` property is an array of `OrganizationReference`'s.\n\n## Example\n\nThe following JSON snippet models a PPP contracting process where there is an additional signatory to the contract beyond those defined in the `publicAuthority` and `award/preferredBidders` fields.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"publicAuthority\": {\n    \"name\": \"Ministry of Communications\",\n    \"id\": \"GB-GOV-12345678\"\n  },\n  \"awards\": [\n    {\n      \"preferredBidders\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Example Consortium\",\n          \"id\": \"GB-COH-00000000\"\n        },\n      ]\n    },\n  ],\n  \"contract\": {\n    \"signatories\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Ministry of Communications\",\n        \"id\": \"GB-GOV-12345678\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Example Consortium\",\n        \"id\": \"GB-COH-00000000\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Telecommunications UK\",\n        \"id\": \"GB-GOV-99999999\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage notes\n\nEach signatory to the contract should have an associated entry in the `parties` section of OCDS.\n\nThis extension follows the approach to modelling organizations introduced in OCDS V1.1.\n\n## Issues\n\nReport issues for this extension in the [ocds-extensions repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-extensions/issues), putting the extension's name in the issue's title.\n",

In PPP cases, these additional dimensions may mirror those used in the estimated demand and other metrics sections.\n\n### Worked example\n\nThe example below shows a very simply tariff table, without periods or units, but with two dimensions. Tariffs which relate to a particular set of dates could have a `period` block. Those which relate to a particular unit (e.g. tonnes) could have this indicated using a `unit` block.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tariffs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"1.0\",\n      \"title\": \"Standard Toll\",\n      \"dimensions\": {\n        \"vehicleType\": \"Class 1\",\n        \"registration\": \"No registration\"\n      },\n      \"value\": {\n        \"amount\": \"0.0\",\n        \"currency\": \"GBP\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"2.0\",\n      \"title\": \"Standard Toll\",\n      \"dimensions\": {\n        \"vehicleType\": \"Class 2\",\n        \"registration\": \"No registration\"\n      },\n      \"value\": {\n        \"amount\": \"2.0\",\n        \"currency\": \"GBP\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"3.0\",\n      \"title\": \"Standard Toll\",\n      \"dimensions\": {\n        \"vehicleType\": \"Class 3\",\n        \"registration\": \"No registration\"\n      },\n      \"value\": {\n        \"amount\": \"6.0\",\n        \"currency\": \"GBP\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"4.0\",\n      \"title\": \"Standard Toll\",\n      \"dimensions\": {\n        \"vehicleType\": \"Class 4\",\n        \"registration\": \"No registration\"\n      },\n      \"value\": {\n        \"amount\": \"8.0\",\n        \"currency\": \"GBP\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Codelist entries\n\nThe following document types are introduced by the tariff extension\n\n* tariffs - For providing tariff and pricing schedules.\n* tariffMethod - For summarizing the method by which tariffs are set, and linking to detailed documentation of the methods for setting tariffs. This may include written documentation, and spreadsheets providing the models used to calculate tariffs.\n* tariffReview - For summarizing the arrangements for the review and regulation of tariffs, and linking to detailed documentation that covers how tariffs are regulated. This is important to explain to users why they are paying what they are paying, and the scope for changes to payment structures.\n* tariffIllustration - For linking to graphs and reports on the change over time in tariff prices. Use the relevant image media type when linking to PNG, JPEG or GIF graphs to allow applications to directly display this content.\n\n## Issues\n\nReport issues for this extension in the [ocds-extensions repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-extensions/issues), putting the extension's name in the issue's title.\n\n## Changelog\n\n2018-05-08 - Make `tariff/id` required to support revision tracking and [list merging](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/schema/merging/#lists).\n",
