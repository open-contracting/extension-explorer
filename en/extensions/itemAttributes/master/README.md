# Item attributes

Adds an `attributes` array to the item object to list any
extra attribute that an item may have, at the tender, award or
contract stage.
The attributes can be features like the item's model, brand, manufacturer, among others, including its value and an
unique identifier for that attribute

## Example

{
  "tender": {
    "items": [

        "quantity": 350,
        "attributes": [

            "value": "BOLSA",
            "id": "1"
