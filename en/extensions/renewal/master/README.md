# Renewal

Adds fields to describe the options for the renewal of contracts.

## Legal context

In the European Union, this extension's fields correspond to [eForms BT-57 (Renewal Description)](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/reference/business-terms/). For correspondences to Tenders Electronic Daily (TED), see [OCDS for the European Union](https://standard.open-contracting.org/profiles/eu/latest/en/).

## Guidance

If the number of times a contract can be renewed is an exact number and not a range, set `minimumRenewals` and `maximumRenewals` to the same number.
